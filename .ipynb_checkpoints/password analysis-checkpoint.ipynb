    "# Introduction\n",
    "The motivation behind this notebook is to determine how strong a password is. And not just by looking at entropy analysis or how complex a password is, but by looking at the correlation of password strength and how it varies when compared against a number of different categories which we can categorize the password string by.\n",

    "# Background Research\n",
    "It is so often said to us that we should use passwords that are not common words. But let's say my password is 'klo$0', instead of what I would usually use (not) 'y@tin'.\n",

    "Both these passwords are 8 characters each. The idea is that a computer program can probably guess these passwords in an insignificant amount of time can be worrying. Let's just try it ourselves and see how long it would take for a computer to find these two passwords:"
